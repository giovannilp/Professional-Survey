## 📚 About Data
Historical data on the modern Olympic Games, from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual event, including the athlete's name, sex, age, height, weight, country, and medal, and the event's name, sport, games, year, and city.

### ✏️ Data Set:
120 Years of Olympic History from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/120-years-of-olympic-history)

##  📌 Business Task
"As a data analyst working at a news company you are asked to visualize data that will help readers understand how countries have performed historically in the summer Olympic Games. You also know that there is an interest in details about the competitors, so if you find anything interesting then don’t hesitate to bring that in also. The main task is still to show historical performance for different countries, with the possibility to select your own country."
